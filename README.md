# CMPE-140-Final-Project-
This project simulates a tic-tac-toe game on an *n × n* grid (5 ≤ n ≤ 100). Two players (‘X’ and ‘O’) take turns placing beans on the grid. A player wins by forming a line of three beans (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) with no opponent's bean in between. The game ends when a player wins or after 10 moves each.
